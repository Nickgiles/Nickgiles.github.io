<h1> York Maine </h1>
<p1 style="background-color:red;margin-left:38px;">I grew up on the southeastern point of Maine in York. </p1>
</p> Growing up I had 3 beaches and close accessibility to everything New England has to offer. This allowed me to do a lot of different things growing up like surfing, skiing, and playing hockey. All of these things helped to shape who I am today. </p2>
